                <h2>Functions</h2>
                
                    <p>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
                        Generally speaking, a function is a "subprogram" that can be called by code external (or internal in the case of recursion) to the function. 
                        Like the program itself, a function is composed of a sequence of statements called the function body. 
                        Values can be passed to a function, and the function will return a value.
                        In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, because they can have properties and methods just like any other object. What distinguishes them from other objects is that functions can be called. In brief, they are Function objects.</p>

                    <h2>Objects</h2>
                    <p>An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality (which usually consists of several variables and functions — which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects.) 
                            JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties or methods.

                            <h2>Arrays</h2>
                            <p>
                                    Arrays are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. Neither the length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed. 
                                    Since an array's length can change at any time, and data can be stored at non-contiguous locations in the array, 
                                    JavaScript arrays are not guaranteed to be dense; this depends on how the programmer chooses to use them. 
                                    In general, these are convenient characteristics; but if these features are not desirable for your particular use, you might consider using typed arrays.

                                    Arrays cannot use strings as element indexes (as in an associative array) but must use integers. 
                                    Setting or accessing via non-integers using bracket notation (or dot notation) will not set or retrieve an element from the array list itself, 
                                    but will set or access a variable associated with that array's object property collection. 
                                    The array's object properties and list of array elements are separate, and the array's traversal and mutation operations cannot be applied to these named properties.
